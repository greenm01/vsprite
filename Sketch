/* Ooops, someone already did that work... from SVG tokenizer (svg.cc):

  - spaces are allowed (except within a number) as well as ','
  - a number starts with '-' or number.
  - a number ends when the next character is not a number or '.'
  - a command is a letter. Allowed letters are:
    Z z - closePath (0)
    L l - lineto (2)
    H h - horizontal lineto (1)
    V v - vertical lineto (1)
    C c - curveto (6)
    S s - smooth curveto (4)
    Q q - quadratic bezier curveto (4)
    T t - smooth quadratic bezier curveto (2)
    A a - elliptical arc (7)
  - Each command is followed by n arguments. The arguments can be
    repeated by multiply of n to mark up another similar command.
